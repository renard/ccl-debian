Description: Clozure Common Lisp compiler and development system 
 Clozure CL (often called CCL for short) is a free Common Lisp
 implementation with a long history. Some distinguishing features
 of the implementation include fast compilation speed, native threads,
 a precise, generational, compacting garbage collector, and a
 convenient foreign-function interface.
